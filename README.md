# Pneumonia-Identification-ML
The aim of this project is to identify pneumonia diagnosis for children between 1 and 5 years old in the early stages with the highest accuracy.
There are multiple ML models tested in this project:
- K-Means
- Logistic Regression
- Classification and Decision Tree
- kNN
- Random Forest
- Combined model (2 best ones chosen)

Check out the paper to find which one brought the best accuracy.

Thank you,
